# PyBer_Analysis
# Overview of Analysis

V. Isualize has asked us to create a summary and an analysis of the ridesharing data based on the fares by city type. We will summarize the data with a data frame and we will create a visualization to compare the fares across the different types of cities. Ultimately we will point out the differences by city types in order to help PyBer make an informed decision with their data. 

As you look at the table below, you can compare the average fair per ride and the average fair per driver for each city type. You can also look at the total fares and the total number of rides by city type.

## Rural Area

In rural cities there are a lot less drivers, only 78 total, but the average fair per ride is the highest at $34.62. This is because each ride that a person takes is probably longer since rural areas are spread out. As a driver in a rural area, you can make $55.48 on average per ride. This is actually the sweet spot for drivers to be. They will be getting the most rides based on total rides divided by total drivers and they will be getting paid the highest.
## Suburban Area

Suburban areas have a lot more drivers, 490 and the average fair per ride is not much smaller than a rural area, at $30.97. However, a driver will make $15.50 less on average per ride. When comparing total rides per driver there are actually less rides that a driver will make in a suburban area compare to a rural area. A driver will only make 1.2 rides on average and their average fair will be lower.
## Urban Area
Lastly, there are the drivers in the urban areas. The urban area drivers only make an average of $16.57 per drive. Additionally, there are 1625 rides total in the urban area but a total of 2405 drivers. This means that not all drivers are even giving rides. 
## Summary

In summary, it seems like a driver should go out to the rural area if they want to make more money because they will make more money for each ride and they will have the most rides to drive. Additionally, the CEO should recommend that more drivers from the urban areas move out to the rural areas to take more rides out there. There should be less drivers in total in the urban areas. It is also important to note that the company should still focus their efforts on the urban areas because it brings in the most income, based on the chart below, you can see it is the highest total fare consistently.
